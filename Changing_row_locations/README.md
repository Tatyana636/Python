# Changing row locations
The program receives separately first the number of rows, then the number of columns, then the number of the first row, then the second, which need to be swapped.
An array of rows and columns is generated automatically using the random module and the randrange function in Python.
As a result, two arrays of elements are displayed: the initial one and the modified one.
