# Complete graph
The script checks whether the graph is complete(any pair of its different vertices is connected by at least one edge) or not.
In the first line, enter the number n (1≤n≤100) – the number of vertices in the graph, in the second m ( 1≤m≤10000) – the number of edges. 
Then follows in a line, through a space of pair of numbers - edges of the graph.
For example:
 1 2
 3 4
 2 8 and so on. 
The result is "YES" if the graph is complete, and "NO" otherwise.
