# Model of the game " Drunkard"
The program receives two lines for input: the first line contains 5 cards 
the first player, the second-5 cards of the second player. Maps are listed 
from top to bottom, that is, each line begins with the card that will be 
opened the first. 
The output displays the word "first" or "second", meaning the win of 1 or 2 players. Then displays the number of moves made before winning. 
If the game does not end within 106 moves, the program should print the word "botva".
